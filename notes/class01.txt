Annotations:

1.@Test:
All the test cases must be written down under the annotation of @Test.


whenever u run a class , it is going to execute each and every method under the annotation of
@Test.

by deafult @Test annotation follows alphabetical order of execution of the test cases

e.g public void atestcase(); --> will execute first
    public void btestcase();-->will execute second

    the geeen tick indicates that test case has passed
    the red sign idnicates the test case has failed



@BeforeMethod annotation:

the code under this annotation is going to execute everytime before each and every @Test execution is made



@AfterMethod annotation :

the code under this annotation is going to execute after every test Method (after every @TEST)


Assertions:
we are not using if else condition because even if the test case fails (i.e the conditon doesnt pass in if)
the testNG will still show it has passed
in order to overcome that we use
Assertions from testNG
the library is Assert
and we call differnet types of assertions from it

first assertion that we learned is
1.Assert.AssertEquals(String , String)
it comapres two strings if they are equal test case passed else fails.

2.Assert.AssetTrue(boolean)-->if the boolean is True the Assertion will pass
								if the boolean is false the assertion will fail
